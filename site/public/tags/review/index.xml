      <title>iPad Pro Review</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/blog/2016/02/08/ipad-pro-review/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/ipad-pro-screenshot-1.jpg" /></a><br>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the iPad Pro for a couple months now, and I’m going to give my impressions strictly from an illustrator/comic artist perspective. If you want a review of the device as a laptop replacement or next-gen tablet, others have done a better job than I could, so please check them out.
How does the drawing experience stack up against the competition? The question most artists want answered is how well does the drawing experience stack up vs a Cintiq or a Surface Pro (3&amp;frasl;4).]]>

      <title>Surface Pro 3 Review</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/blog/2014/08/28/surface-pro-3-review/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/sp3-screenshot-1.jpg" /></a><br>Since Baby Yount was born, I&amp;rsquo;ve been concerned about maintaining my productivity. I&amp;rsquo;d heard somewhere that raising children eats into your free time, so I was looking for something that would allow me to make incremental progress on comics during my lunch breaks and whenever I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be sitting at my home desk with my trusty Cintiq. I&amp;rsquo;d bought the original Surface Pro on super bargain discount, and while I liked it in theory, in practice it was too slow and frustrating to do anything more than lettering or some basic inking on the go.]]>
