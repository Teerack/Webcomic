      <title>The Best Style is No-Template Style</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/blog/2015/08/12/the-best-style-is-no-template-style/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/ss-logo.jpg" /></a><br>IMPORTANT UPDATE:  Due to an undocumented limit on Squarespace&amp;rsquo;s Archive List block, the current solution will not work with &amp;gt;1000 comics in the archive. If your comic archives are more than 1000, or you will reach it soon, please find another solution. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to have launched with this limitation, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an archive with 1000 entries to test on and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t documented, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of it.]]>

      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/blog/2015/08/05/template-less/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/ss-logo.jpg" /></a><br>The No-Template Style I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten some feedback on my webcomic template for Squarespace, and the two biggest complaints are that the $18 per month developer account is too expensive, and the template is too hard to customize for someone with no coding skills whatsoever.
Since I released the template, Squarespace has made a couple updates to their platform that have allowed me to publish a new solution that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a custom template.]]>
