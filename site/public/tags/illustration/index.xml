      <title>Legend of Korra Process - Fire and Water</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/blog/2012/11/19/legend-of-korra-process---fire-and-water/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/korra-progress-2.png" /></a><br>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a new piece for my NovemberP.U.M.M.E.L. match. I picked the theme this time, and I decided on Legend of Korra. I was watching this season, and thought the fire and water effects would be a good way to jump into a more painterly technique. Usually, I sketch, ink, and color with either flats, like in Rob and Elliot, or 1-2 levels of shading/highlights with gradients like in my Storm/Black Panther illustration.]]>
