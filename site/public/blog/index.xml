      <title>Ghostcat Comics (Re)Launch</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/blog/2019/05/27/ghostcat-comics-relaunch/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/profile-avatar.jpg" /></a><br>You may not be aware of this, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been drawing webcomics off and on again since 2000. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken some long breaks and my update schedule has been spotty at best, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always considered it a part of my identity. I draw comics, even if I&amp;rsquo;n not drawing them right now.
There is a small subset of my readership that knows that before there was Hamlet&amp;rsquo;s Danish, and before there was Rob and Elliot, I did a webcomic called Ghostcat.]]>

      <title>Goodbye Squarespace, Hello Hugo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/blog/2018/11/18/goodbye-squarespace-hello-hugo/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/hugo-logo.png" /></a><br>A Little History I originally developed my Squarespace webcomic template because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with having to use Wordpress+ComicPress and I wanted another option. I latched on to Squarespace because it had a pretty robust developer platform and allowed for more customization than any other online website builder. Also, when I started, Squarespace was $8 a month, and cheaper than most hosting solutions, so it seemed like a great deal.]]>

      <title>The Goon Illustration</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/blog/2016/02/26/the-goon-illustration/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/the-goon.jpg" /></a><br>I did an illustration of The Goon for an online art competition
I&amp;rsquo;m still teaching myself how to use Procreate effectively, so this one had a pretty good amount of trial and error as I was figuring things out. I also used a modified old dutch painting technique Ray Frenden blogged about, and I like it a LOT. I also have a process video if anyone is interested.   ]]>

      <title>iPad Pro Review</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/blog/2016/02/08/ipad-pro-review/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/ipad-pro-screenshot-1.jpg" /></a><br>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the iPad Pro for a couple months now, and I’m going to give my impressions strictly from an illustrator/comic artist perspective. If you want a review of the device as a laptop replacement or next-gen tablet, others have done a better job than I could, so please check them out.
How does the drawing experience stack up against the competition? The question most artists want answered is how well does the drawing experience stack up vs a Cintiq or a Surface Pro (3&amp;frasl;4).]]>

      <title>BringBackMST3K</title>

Robot in the upcoming MST3K reboot! To say that this is a big deal for him is a massive understatement.
When we were growing up, we were both huge fans of the show (Though Hampton always loved it more). We pooled our resources to buy a bunch of tapes, and got to the point where we were quoting them a lot.]]>

      <title>Trying Something New</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/blog/2015/11/19/trying-something-new/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/cy-logo.jpg" /></a><br>I know, I know. It&amp;rsquo;s been pretty dead around here. I could attribute it to a lot of things and make excuses, but in the end, I&amp;rsquo;ve been allowing other things in life to take over my productivity. I tend to do this thing where I miss a deadline, then avoid the task completely because I feel bad about it. Couple that with the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about, but lose interest in things quickly, and it pretty much explains my entire update history.]]>

      <title>The Best Style is No-Template Style</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/blog/2015/08/12/the-best-style-is-no-template-style/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/ss-logo.jpg" /></a><br>IMPORTANT UPDATE:  Due to an undocumented limit on Squarespace&amp;rsquo;s Archive List block, the current solution will not work with &amp;gt;1000 comics in the archive. If your comic archives are more than 1000, or you will reach it soon, please find another solution. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to have launched with this limitation, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an archive with 1000 entries to test on and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t documented, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of it.]]>

Since I released the template, Squarespace has made a couple updates to their platform that have allowed me to publish a new solution that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a custom template.]]>

I&amp;rsquo;ll also have cat map posters and comic prints. I hope to see you there, so please stop by and say hello!
On a side note, I know I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a comic hiatus for the past month.]]>

      <title>Other Comics</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/blog/2014/12/11/other-comics/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/bird-comic-1.jpg" /></a><br>In the time between when Rob and Elliot ended and Hamlet&amp;rsquo;s Danish began, I drew a couple short comic stories for an online competition. It was a way for me to keep in practice, and to try and grow as a storyteller. They were based on a random subject chosen for the competition, so they are one off ideas that I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on continuing. I realized that a lot of people who visit this site haven&amp;rsquo;t seen them since they are buried on my artwork page, so I thought I would take the time to post them here.]]>
